# reminder
Basic utility program to set alarm or reminder, written in go. This is an example usage of my scheduler https://github.com/jimpy93/scheduler

Program interacts using Standard IO, uses https://github.com/0xAX/notificator to display Notifications, and https://github.com/vova616/go-openal/openal to play alarm/reminder sounds.

Run the program and follow the instructions to set reminder or alarm. Keep it running to be notified on the set time :)
